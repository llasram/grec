# grec

*grec* - *Global Regual Expresion Color*
(Didn't you know '*grep*' means *Global Regular Expression Print*?)

A tool to quickly colorize output.

It's wildly imperfect. It's slow. It's full of bugs.

## Usage

grec --red 'regex1' --green 'regex2' [filename...]

## Bugs / Todo

[ ] It only takes files (it really needs to understand stdin)
[ ] It only understands RED and GREEN right now
[ ] You have to give it a regex for both --red and --green
